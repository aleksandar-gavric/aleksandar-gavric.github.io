Aleksandar Gavrci is a PhD researcher at TU Wien, working at the Business Informatics Group under Prof. Dominik Bork and Prof. Henderik Proper. His work focuses on world-model construction by integrating multimodal process mining, mixed-reality simulation, and video generation models to capture and model tacit expertise. He build AI systems that learn real-world processes end-to-end from both video and digital systems event logs, unifying conceptual modeling and knowledge elicitation into a continuous learning loop. Previously, he worked with the Lydia Kavraki's, and Edward Knightly's Labs (Rice University), Mackenzie Mathis (EPFL) as a TA in the DeepLabCut course, and founded AI-for-Hotels.com, where he developed RAG, robotics and holographic systems.
